Baroquesize Yourself
====================

A simple web app created for my History of Creativity (BYU Tech202) class' end of semester project. The app allows the user to take a picture of themselves and adjust the image to make the picture look more like baroque style art. The app was demoed at the "creativity fair" where my partner created a photo booth with baroque era props. The original app would allow you to send a link to your picture via your email, but it has been modified to allow you to download the image directly instead.

The app can be viewed at [baroque.benjamin-hansen.com](https://baroque.benjamin-hansen.com).

Currently this app only runs properly on Chrome version 25 or later. Access to the web cam is through WebRTC.
